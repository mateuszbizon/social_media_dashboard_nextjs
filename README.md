- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://social-media-dashboard-nextjs-two.vercel.app/](https://social-media-dashboard-nextjs-two.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

In this project I used for the first time the TailwinCSS framework. At the beginning it was really hard for me to create styles in that way, just in html but after I finished this project I in my opinion Tailwind is super cool framework that allows to create css styles in such easy way.

I used for first time Next.js as well. In this project I used it just to practice Tailwind without any server stuff like database, making requests to backend to get data or making routing to both frontend and backend. In the future I would like to make full stack app using Next.js
